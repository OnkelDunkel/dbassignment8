I tried following below link to set up replication with GTID:

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-howto.html

I did not manage make the master-slave replication work so you shouldn't spend your time on trying to setup the slave to my server to my master.

Anyway the server info are in the peergrade-zip if you still want to have a look.
